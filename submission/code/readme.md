# Text-based Information Retrieval
## Assignment
We have chosen the programming assignment, which is devided into 2 parts.

#### Part I: Warm up
In this part of the assignment, we compare different analogy models using different vector models. Our solution can be found in the folder "Part I".
We have coded this part using python 2.7 in jupyter notebook.
There is also a regular python file to run in pyhton 3+. This file requires you to uncomment the part you wish to run.

*__Note:__ Due to the size of the vector sets, these are not included here. Download links are provided in the jupyter notebook. They are supposed to be in the data folder.*

#### Part II: Image search
This part of the assignment is about making an image search by relating the images to their description. The search will then query through the descriptions to find the best associating image.
The solution for this can be found in the folder "Part II"

We have coded this part using Python 3+.
This part of the assignment is divided into 3 parts:
- basicML: This folder contains the answer for the Simple Language Model. You can run it by [howtorun]
- II - wordembedding.ipynb: This file is the jupyter notebook for the second part of the assignment, where we use wordembedding (word2vec with the GoogleNews dataset). This is also the method that we decided to sent in as our best method, so at the bottom of the page there is a way to run the testqueries. You can run this file by running the cells in order of appearance.
- lda: This file contains our implementation of the LDA method. You can run this file by using jupyter notebook and running each cell in order of appearance.
