# Text-based Information Retrieval
## Deadlines
The assignment is due to **April 29** 

Source code (in C++, Java, MatLab, Python, ...) can be sent by e-mail to: sien.moens@cs.kuleuven.be, gcollell@kuleuven.be, and susana.zoghbi@cs.kuleuven.be.

## Assignment
We have chosen the programming assignment, which is devided into 2 parts.

#### Part I: Warm up
In this part of the assignment, we compare different analogy models using different vector models. Our solution can be found in the folder "Part I".

*__Note:__ Due to the size of the vector sets, these are not included here. Download links are provided in the jupyter notebook.*

#### Part II: Image search
This part of the assignment is about making an image search by relating the images to their description. The search will then query through the descriptions to find the best associating image.
The solution for this can be found in the folder "Part II"

## Tools
For now we are using python 3 in [jupyter notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If a different version of python is installed and still needed for other things, the easiest way to switch between python versions is by using [anaconda](http://anaconda.org/) (and tutorial info [here](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/get-started.html))
