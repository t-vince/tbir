We coded our solution in Python (version 2.7) using IPython Notebook. All experiments were run on a notebook with 8GB RAM memory, Intel(R) CORE\textsuperscript{TM}i7-3610QM CPU, SSD hard disk and a Windows 7 Operating System.

\paragraph{The data}
we received contains the following documents:
\begin{description}
	\item[A. target\_collection] A table representing 17,784 images with as columns a unique numerical ID, an ID that corresponds to the actual image file and a description of the image. This data is used to train our model.
	\item[B. queries\_val] A similar table as the \textit{target\_collection} but it represents 1000 different images. This table will be used to test the accuracy of our trained model.
\end{description}
