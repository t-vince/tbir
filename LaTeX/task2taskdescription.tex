This task is based on the annual Scalable Concept Image Annotation Challenge, organised by ImageCLEF \cite{imageclef}. The dataset (given by ImageCLEF), contains sentence descriptions aligned to actual images. In this part of the assignment, we bring our previous tests into a real-life retrieval scenario in order to retrieve image descriptions using textual queries. Each query has a corresponding image ID, which can be used to verify the correctness of the model. The goal is to match queries with image descriptions as good as possible, using precision and recall as evaluation measures.
