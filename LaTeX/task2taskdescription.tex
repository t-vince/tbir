This task is based on the annual Scalable Concept Image Annotation Challenge, organised by ImageCLEF \cite{imageclef}. The dataset (given by ImageCLEF), contains sentence descriptions aligned to actual images. In this part of the assignment, we bring our previous tests into a real-life retrieval scenario in order to retrieve imagesdescriptions using textual queries. Each query has a correspnding image ID, which can be used to verify the correctness of the retrieval model. The goal is to match queries with imagedescriptions as good as possible, using precision and recall as evaluation measures.
