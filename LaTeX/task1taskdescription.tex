In this part, we discuss two analogy solvers that try to guess the correct word, given simple analogy questions. E.g.:

\begin{align*}
	a : b = c : ?\\
	Bratislava : Slovakia = Bishkek : ?\\
	ate : eat = found : ?
\end{align*}
\newline
Then, we will run several analogy solving models with several different representations on the benchmarking analogy dataset.
